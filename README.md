These are my homework files from the [Coursera] course [Computing for Data
Analysis], a course teaching the basics of data analysis using [R].

Since I was more interested in learning the general approaches to computational
data analysis than the specifics of R, I didn't spend much time learning R
idioms.  This, combined with R's many questionable design decisions, has
resulted in some amazingly awful code.  If you happen to take this course,
please do not look at my solutions before writing yours - not only is it
dishonest, but you'll be doing yourself a disservice.

If you are interested in doing computational data analysis, I recommend [Python
for this task][python-science].  Unfortunately, the [introductory docs] for the
relevant Python libraries seem geared at previous users of R and Matlab,
leaving me entirely confused until this course.  (And no, I'm not aware of any
good introductions to data analysis using Python - please let me know if you
find one!)  So, for now my recommendation is to take this course, or [another
like it][stats-classes], suffer through some R, and then take the knowledge
you've learned into a much better-designed language and ecosystem.
